I have made centralized loaning system of bank that take particular rate of interest and give you loan for the time you need, interest taken is on the left principle balance in your loan account this is the system that RBI and any other bank follow.

There are a lot of disadvantages of Centralisation process of banking:

(a) Slow decision making which deals with inappropriate and delay customer services,
(b) Decisions are based on opinions and feelings than on facts and lacks transparency in decision making process since the decision makers are dealing with paper not with the facts, figures and status.
(c) Itâ€™s a time consuming process; there is no scope to consider urgency, sudden incident and other reasons.
(d) Flow of the money is obstructed ,it reduces liquidity of money which in turn is not good for any financial activity an somehow affect people,state and nation.
